111111Phase 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
Goal: Gather historical weather data for a chosen region and clean it.

Choosing a data source:

OpenWeatherMap API (limited history)
NOAA's Climate Data API (more detailed historical data)
Kaggle weather datasets (pre-cleaned data)
Preprocess the data:

Convert timestamps
Handle missing values
Extract key weather features (temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.)

Phase 2: Probability Modeling
Goal: Calculate the probability of a specific weather pattern occurring.

Basic probability:

Compute frequency distributions of weather patterns (e.g., "Rain" on given dates).
Use conditional probabilities (e.g., probability of rain given high humidity).
Statistical models:

Markov Chains: Model the likelihood of weather transitions (e.g., sunny â†’ rainy).
Bayesian Probability: Update weather predictions based on prior observations.

Phase 3: Machine Learning for Prediction
Goal: Improve prediction accuracy using ML techniques.

Time Series Forecasting:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for trend-based forecasting.
Facebook Prophet for seasonal weather pattern detection.
Deep Learning (LSTM, CNNs):

Use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential weather data.
Use Random Forest or XGBoost for pattern classification.

Phase 4: Visualization & User Interaction
Goal: Present insights in a user-friendly format.

Matplotlib/Seaborn for probability distributions.
Streamlit for an interactive web app to input a location and see probabilities.
