Phase 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
Goal: Gather historical weather data for a chosen region and clean it.

Choose a data source:

OpenWeatherMap API (limited history)
NOAA's Climate Data API (more detailed historical data)
Kaggle weather datasets (pre-cleaned data)
Preprocess the data:

Convert timestamps
Handle missing values
Extract key weather features (temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.)
